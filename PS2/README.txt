Hey.

This was designed for simple environments. It achieved 100% of marks in simple environments.

Each of part B is separated into its own folder. Add all images you want (AND NO MORE OR LESS - preferably 25) to the same location 
as the python file and simply run the python file. It will check all images with PNG <- PNG and PNG only no JPG etc
and write new images in the same folder completeing the task. In each folder is a results folder for all 25 simple images already
detected.

The functionality includes dectecting cards, determining their pixel location, their pose in XY and the distance between the cards. The results that the program was designed for can be found in the Results folder



Libraries required:

The program uses the latest verion of Python 3.7. It's a pretty basic program and should work with 3.5+ but everyone
should have the latest version of python, you can download it for free here with pip installed:

In the installation make sure you include pip as an optional feature. It should be selected
to be installed by default.
IMPORTANT:

The program uses opencv and numpy. They're basic libraries that can be installed using pip:

That covers everything have fun:)
